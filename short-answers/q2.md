# Question
Look at this `break` statement:

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i > 7) break;
  console.log(i)
}
```

Is there any way we could achieve the exact same functionality with a `for` loop, but *without* using the `break` statement?

# Answer
One way to do this would be to remove the `if (i > 7) break;` and change `i < 10` to `i <= 7`. This is assuming that the instructions does not ask for i to reach 10 anyways.
